Silent's Abyss

Originally the mod that became Silent's Gems, this mod intended to add a new dimension as well as tools. I felt it was too ambitious for my first mod, hence the change to Silent's Gems with a focus on tools.

Now, I feel like I might be up to the task of a new dimension. This mod will not replace Silent's Gems, but be a companion mod to it. I'm not making any promises, but I will be working on this as I feel like it.
