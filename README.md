Silent's Abyss
===========

A Minecraft mod about shiny gems and colorful tools/blocks. In the future, I
plan on adding a new dimension for players to explore, full of loot and
powerful monsters.

Note that this mod is still early in development.
WORLD-BREAKING CHANGES MAY OCCUR DURING DEVELOPMENT, although I will do my best
to keep those to a minimum.

Also please backup your worlds before installing new mods. I am not responsible
for any damage done to your save files.
