Chaos and You
SilentChaos512

§nChaos§r Chaos is a mysterious force that governs unpredictable (and often dangerous) events (Chaos Events).

§nChaos Level§r The chaos level is the sum of chaos energy in the world. It will slowly rise if below a certain level, and slowly fall if above that level. Also, using certain artifacts can alter the chaos level.

§nChaos Factor§r The chaos factor rises exponentially with the chaos level. The higher the chaos factor, the higher the chance of chaos events occuring.

§nChaos Events§r Sometimes chaos will cause strange events, called chaos events. These include meteor showers and strange creatures appearing. Walls and roofs are good defenses against many chaos events.
