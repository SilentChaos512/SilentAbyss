An Attempt to Explain Sigils
SilentChaos512

§nAbyss Sigils§r Sigils are powerful magical items. They can light enemies on fire, heal you, and teleport you home. Or any combination of those things and more.

§nCrafting§r You will need a Sigil Infuser and some Sigil Stones. Place non-empty Sigil Stones into the Sigil Infuser to craft Abyss Sigils. The order of the Sigil Stones determines the effects (see Grammar).

§nSigil Stones§r Sigil Stones are the "words" that describe a Sigil. Up to four are allowed per Sigil. Multiple "effect" words are allowed on one Sigil. "Modifiers" are applied to the first effect that follows them.

§nGrammar§r Sigil Stones can be divided into two rough categories: - Effects (nouns) - Modifiers (adjectives) Effects describe what happens when a Sigil is used. Examples: Fireball, Cloak, Teleport Modifiers change the details of the effects. Examples: Amplify, Colors

Not all effects accept all modifiers. For example, "Pink Teleport" makes no sense, so the "Pink" word will be ignored. Nonsense modifiers have no ill effects, so feel free to color-code teleports if you need to.

§nExamples§r Red Amplify Amplify Fireball: Shoots a red fireball that does 100% extra damage. Speed Remedy Healing Teleporter: Removes potion effects (such as poison), heals 3 hearts, teleports you home, and takes less time to use.
